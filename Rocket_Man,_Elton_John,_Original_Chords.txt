Rocket Man - Elton John
 
 
[Verse 1]
Gm7                                    C9
   She packed my bags last night - pre-flight
Gm7                C9
   Zero hour, nine A.M.
D#                  A#/D     Cm    Cm/A#              F/A   F
  And I'm gonna be high -i-high       as a kite by then
Gm7                            C9
   I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
Gm7                   C9
   It's lonely out in space                                   ^ ^
D#           A#/D     Cm             Cm/A#    F/A   F/C   F     D#
  On such a ti - i -imeless flight
 
 
[Chorus]
A#                                      D#
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
                                        A#
Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
                                   D#
I'm not the man they think I am at home
           A#/D       C9
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
D#                                   A#           D#
Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone
 
A#                                      D#
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
                                        A#
Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
                                   D#
I'm not the man they think I am at home
           A#/D       C9
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
D#                                   A#           D#
Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone
 
 
[Verse 2]
Gm7                              C9
   Mars ain't the kinda place to raise your kids
Gm7                      C9
    In fact it's cold as hell
D#                     A#/D      Cm         Cm/A#         F/A   F/C   F
   And there's no one there to raise them       if you did
Gm7                                     C
    And all this science, I don't under stand
Gm7                              C
    It's just my job five days a week
       D#     A#           Cm    Cm/A#        F/A   F/C   F
Rocket man  -aaa  -a -a- an         rocket man
 
 
[Chorus]
A#                                      D#
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
                                        A#
Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
                                   D#
I'm not the man they think I am at home
           A#/D        C9
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
D#                                   A#           D#
Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone
 
A#                                       D#
  And I think it's gonna be a long long time
                                        A#
Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
                                   D#
I'm not the man they think I am at home
           A#/D       C9
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
D#                                   A#
Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone
 
 
[Outro]
D#                             A#
  And I think it's gonna be a long long time
D#                             A#
  And I think it's gonna be a long long time
